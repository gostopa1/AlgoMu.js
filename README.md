The main concern of this project was to play around with WebAudio possibilities and test some algorithmic music approaches using javascript. 

The notes are chosen in a random order from a set of notes. The scale is 12-tone scale but can be easily changes. Central frequency is at 440.

The sounds are then convolved to a reverb.

The result is interesting but the code is nothing extravagant. I'll be glad though if it appears to be helpful to anybody.
